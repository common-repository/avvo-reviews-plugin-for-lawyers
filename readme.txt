<strong>Easy-To-Use</strong>

This plugin can be added to any section of your website (post, page, widget, etc.). All you need to do is to insert the following shortcode to any Wordpress page, widget or post:  

    [reviews acc="URL of lawyer on Avvo" rating="number of reviews stars" limit="number of reviews to display"]

or PHP code anywhere you want:

    echo do_shortcode('[reviews acc="URL of lawyer on Avvo"  rating="number of reviews stars" limit="number of reviews to display"]');

<strong>Synchronization</strong>

You do not need to update the plugin if any new reviews appear on Avvo, as it collects the data directly from your account. The data will refresh automatically in real-time mode.

<strong>Ability To Manage Reviews</strong>

Now you can manage Avvo reviews on your website and specify those postings you would like to show. If you have 1 or 2-star reviews, you can exclude them from page or widget by adding special digit to rating in your shortcode. For example:

    [reviews acc="account url" rating="4" limit="4"]

Rating="4" means that only reviews with 4+ star rating will appear on your website. With this option you can display only positive reviews from your clients, hiding negative ones. Limit="4" means that only 4 testimonials will be displayed. Rating and limit are optional attributes.
